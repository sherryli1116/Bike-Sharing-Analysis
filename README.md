# Bike-Sharing-Analysis
## Overview
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. <br /> The purpose of this analysis is to use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we then create a set of visualizations to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. 
## Result

### Checkout Time for users
The visualization shows us that most rides last between fifteen to thirty minutes.

### Checkout Times By Gender
In this visualization, the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender, it than reveals that males are the majority riders and they are 3 times than the other groups.

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour
This visualization presents the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap. The weekdays show us two peak times: the first is between 7 AM - 9 AM, and the next one is between 5 PM - 6 PM.

### Trips By Gender (Weekday Per Hour)
In this visualization, the graph shows the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap. The darker color indicates that males are really using the bikes between 5 PM - 6 PM during the week.

### User Trips By Gender By Weekday
In this visualization, the number of bike trips by gender for each hour for each day of the week as a heatmap. Male subscribers are showing a high usage rate during the week which is a very consistent result throughout our visualizations.

## Summary
So as a result, we are very informed about the riding habits of people who live in Des Moines and this city it is a suitable place for us to continue the bike sharing program. In addition, I would suggest two additional visualizations: the first one is a visualizaion of revenue by gender in weekdays so we can know which gender can generate a greater monetary value. The other visualization can be trips distance by week days so we can know people's riding habits more.
