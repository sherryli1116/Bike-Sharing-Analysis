# Bike-Sharing-Analysis
## Overview
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. <br /> The purpose of this analysis is to use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we then create a set of visualizations to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. 
## Result
### Checkout Time for users
The visualization shows us that most rides last between fifteen to thirty minutes.
